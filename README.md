Bio-DB-Das-BioSQL
======================

These modules provide a DasI API to BioSQL (see http://biosql.org). With this package you can use 
BioSQL as a backend database for JBrowse (see http://jbrowse.org).

This supercedes version .03 in CPAN, which is missing a number of useful methods and can not
be used with JBrowse.

This code was last used with JBrowse in 2014. No reports either of issues or success with JBrowse have been reported since then.
